Backtracking
backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems.
The idea is that it incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, 
and abandons a candidate ("backtrack") 
as soon as it determines that this candidate cannot lead to a final solution.

use recursion to solve this and to understand recursion use tree on paper 
it will be easy to iterate over each case
